Hello World
===========

Use [purerl](https://github.com/purerl) and
[spago](https://github.com/spacchetti/spago) to build a hello world program.

## Dependencies
I use nix to get the dependencies. Currently only works on macOS.

## Building and running
```
$ nix-shell
$ spago install
$ make run
```
